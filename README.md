# sinosino
The discord bot Sino is a project I developed at the Bullnice BV internship using python and the discord library. 
Sino basically works liken a Pomodoro. It helps you keep track of your studying and break time. The bot alarms the user of the beggi覺nings and endings of their break and work t覺me intervals. The most popular bots on discord are music bots, this bot also has the capabilities of a music bot, mak覺ng the bot and timer a convenient combination. 
Along with the alarm you are send a notiificat覺on. The bot can also be used as a basic calculator. 
Attached are images which show the code and how the bot works.

with main.py and music.py files you can get a chance to meet with SINO! :)
